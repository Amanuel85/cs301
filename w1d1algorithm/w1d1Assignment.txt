1 What happens when an assignment is performed without using let or const keywords in strict mode?
In strict mode if assignment is performed without let or const it will give error, but without strict mode for example we can assign x = 7 and y = 8 and console x + y and it does not give error. Therefore, we need to use strict mode to use the modern way of JavaScript and avoid some problems

3 How is a computer program similar/ different than an algorithm
The basic similarity between computer program and algorithm is that both are step by step instructions or process to do some task. 
The difference between algorithm and computer programs is algorithm is not language specific while computer programs need to be written in a specific language that the computer cand understand such as JavaScript, Java, Python etc. Computer programs are language specific. 
4 Write at least two algorithms you perform on your daily life, with at least one algorithm that can be converted to computer program.
